# Miter Design

Make sure you have Node v16+ and npm v7+

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

Note: when testing production builds locally, don't use sym links. Instead, run the build command and then run `npm pack`, referencing the ignored `.tgz` file in other modules instead of the `npm link` output.

### Run your unit tests

```
npm run test:unit
```

### Lints and fixes files

```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
