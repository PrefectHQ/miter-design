# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "test"
  test:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # reads the node version set in .nvmrc
      - name: Read .nvmrc
        run: echo "##[set-output name=NVMRC;]$(cat .nvmrc)"
        id: nvm

      # installs a specific version of nodejs
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: "${{ steps.nvm.outputs.NVMRC }}"

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Install Modules
        run: npm ci install
